                    <p class="biography-text">Pianist Pei-Shan Lee's playing has been praised in Strad Magazine as "glittering… sensuous, tender, and luminous," The Boston Musical Intelligencer writes of her "gorgeous tone and color range" with "monumental orchestral sonorities," The Boston Globe calls her "dynamic," The Washington Post hails her as a "consummate" artist, and the Maine Classical Beat commends her gift for "holding it all together… as the composer directing from the piano."</p>
                    
                    <p class="biography-text">Lee's concert career spans major halls in the U.S. and abroad. Highlights include performances at the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall in New York; Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.; Jordan Hall in Boston; and Severance Hall in Cleveland. Internationally, she has performed in Belgium, France, Germany, Finland, Israel, Taiwan, and China. She has appeared at prestigious festivals including Mostly Mozart, Caramoor, Great Lakes, Rockport, and Bowdoin in the U.S.; the Cello Festival in Brussels; ProQuartet in Paris; piano festivals in Spain and Russia; Taiwan's Formosa Chamber Music Festival; and China's Great Wall International Music Academy.</p>

                    <p class="biography-text">A deeply committed chamber musician, Lee has collaborated with the Ariel, Borromeo, Formosa, Harlem, Jupiter, and Szymanowski Quartets, as well as Principals of the major orchestras of Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Diego, Toronto, and Munich. She has performed with violinists Cathy Cho, Stefan Jackiw, Ayano Ninomiya, and Ian Swensen; violists James Dunham, Ed Gazouleas, and Dimitri Murrath; and cellists Lluís Claret, Paul Katz, Laurence Lesser, and Pieter Wispelwey, among many others. Based in Boston, she regularly appears with her esteemed colleagues of the New England Conservatory and has worked closely with Boston Ballet and guest artists of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.</p>
                    
                    <p class="biography-text">Lee is also a respected educator and advocate for the collaborative piano field. A faculty member at the New England Conservatory since 2009, she mentors a talented class of graduate students, curates the Sonata Night series, and helped develop NEC's unique five-year dual degree program (BM in Piano and MM in Collaborative Piano). In 2013, she launched the graduate collaborative piano program at California State University Northridge and founded the collaborative piano fellowship at the Bowdoin International Music Festival, where she has served as collaborative piano director since 2015. Her doctoral thesis, The Collaborative Pianist: Balancing Roles in Partnership, has become a widely referenced resource in higher education.</p>
                    
                    <p class="biography-text">Lee's experience extends to new music and documentary film as well. She was a founding member of Da Camera Society's "DC8" new music ensemble in Los Angeles and appears in the films The Portrait (with Anne-Sophie Mutter) and Talent Has Hunger (with Paul Katz). She served as studio pianist for Itzhak Perlman at the Perlman Music Program in 2006 and later joined the faculty for PMP's Sarasota Winter Residency. She has held positions at the Cleveland Institute of Music, Meadowmount School of Music, and the Chautauqua Institution. Her performances have been featured on WQXR, WGBH, and WRCJ, and her recording of the Strauss and Szymanowski sonatas with violinist Grzegorz Kotow is available on the ArchiMusic label.</p>
                    
                    <p class="biography-text">Her principal teachers include Irma Vallecillo, Anne Epperson, Jonathan Feldman, and Solomon Mikowsky in the U.S., and Yu-Yun Chen, Su-Chen Kuo, and Song-Ren Hsu in Taiwan.</p>

                <article class="tc-panel">

                        <h3 class="tc-panel-heading">Why I Love Collaborative Piano</h3>
                        <p class="tc-panel-paragraph">
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">I was fortunate to have begun my schooling in an exceptional musical environment where everyone in my class, from grade one through six, was a “music major.”</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">There was lots of musical interaction, and every week all grades would come together for singing in chorus and playing in orchestra.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">In fact, I was just 6 years old when I played my first duo: Mozart’s e minor Sonata for Piano and Violin, K. 304.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">I still remember how much I loved playing with the violinist and how fearless I was at her final exam!</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">She was one year my senior and near a nervous breakdown as we went in to play for a really scary jury.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Instinctively I moved to calm her, touching her shoulder and holding her very shaky right hand for a few seconds.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">I had no idea if that helped settle her, but later she told me how thrilled she was that her bow didn’t shake!</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Throughout my high school years, I continued to benefit from a specialized musical education, and it became more than natural for me to play for my classmates’ lessons, exams, recitals, etc.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">It is no different today!</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Supporting the people I play with both musically and emotionally brings me great personal satisfaction–I feel I have done something good for the day.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">As a kid in Taiwan, my piano focus was solo, and I first came to the U.S. to continue the study of solo piano.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">It was after spending a year in the U.S. that I learned that several major conservatories offered graduate degrees in “Accompanying”.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">This was something unheard of in Taiwan (fortunately it’s different now!)</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">I decided to expedite my undergraduate studies, earned my bachelor’s degree in three years, and was admitted to the master’s degree program in “Accompanying” at The Juilliard School.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Today, the program has been more appropriately renamed “Collaborative Piano”.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Immediately I felt this field is where I belong—I was so content that I could concentrate on (and financially support myself with) what I loved doing all my life.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Throughout my undergraduate years, I worked 9 to 6 Saturdays at the pre-college, running from one place to another every half-hour (the pay back then was $6 for 30 minutes!) and gaining invaluable experience playing with other people.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">This is how I discovered my passion.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Today I am completely devoted to all aspects of the collaborative field—I perform, I teach, and I am excited to be building graduate collaborative piano programs.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">While some friends seemed disappointed that I did not continue to pursue more solo playing, they didn’t realize that because of my formative years in Taiwan I have never thought of collaborative piano as something less important.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">I love playing the piano, both solo and collaborative, but to put it simply, making music with others is what brings me true fulfillment.</span>

                        <h3 class="tc-panel-heading">The Journey & The Craft</h3>
                        <p class="tc-panel-paragraph">
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Trying to decide whether to enter this field? There are young pianists today considering these same choices and I hope that sharing my background here has been helpful. </span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Collaborative Piano is not an escape from difficult repertoire—it is an art form and a career choice, a different role for those who truly love the piano and love making music with others. </span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Studying collaborative piano at the graduate level is busy but ideal for learning repertoire and accumulating experience. Your day is filled with personal practice, rehearsals, playing for your partner's lessons, in classes, concerts, student juries and recitals. </span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Having solid training as a pianist is really a prerequisite–the repertoire we have to learn and keep in our fingers is enormous, not to mention all the related skills like lyric diction, opera coaching, and score reading. </span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">If you are a good pianist who loves to work hard, enjoys people and the exchange of musical ideas, and takes pleasure in both leading and supportive roles, then collaborative piano is probably for you. You may spend more time at the piano than ever before, but your life will be richer in ways that you cannot imagine.</span>

                        <h3 class="tc-panel-heading">Balancing Roles & Building Programs</h3>
                        <p class="tc-panel-paragraph">
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">Working and studying at four major music conservatories in the U. S. taught me how essential a collaborative piano program is to the success of the rest of a school.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">I became aware of what worked and what didn’t, and how challenging it could be to balance the education of a collaborative piano major with the service needs of the institution.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">As a doctoral student, I began teaching sonata coaching and collaborative courses to pianists and instrumentalists, organizing several departmental events, and started to look for subjects for my doctoral thesis.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">When I discovered that more and more music schools of the world were beginning to establish collaborative piano programs, I realized I could potentially be of help by writing about what I had learned–I have been educated in three of the best collaborative piano programs in the world!</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">The bulk of my paper examines how to balance the service needs of a school accompanying system with the demanding curriculum of a MM in Collaborative Piano.</span>
                            <span class="tc-anim-line">In particular, it is unfortunate that some school administrators think of this program only as a way to attract pianists to play for their instrumental and vocal students, a misguided oversimplification that never works.</span>

                    <p class="quote-text">"Pei-Shan Lee's performance of the Sibelius Violin Concerto was nothing short of revelatory. Her technical command is absolute, but it's her profound musicality and emotional depth that truly set her apart. In her hands, this familiar concerto sounded fresh and newly discovered, with each phrase shaped with purpose and meaning."</p>
